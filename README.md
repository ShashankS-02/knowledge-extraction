1. NumPy & Pandas:
   * Fundamental Python libraries for numerical **computing** and data manipulation.

3. TensorFlow:
   * Open-source library for machine learning, particularly building and training neural networks.
   * Used to **build and train** the LLM model

5. Langchain:
   * Library designed specifically for working with large language models (LLMs).
   * Used to interact with the pre-trained LLM model, potentially for feeding text data and retrieving its analysis or generated information.

6. Scikit-Learn:
   * Popular machine learning library offering a variety of tools for data processing, modeling, and evaluation.
   * Used for K-means clustering and KNN

8. Universal Sentence Encoder (USE):
   * Pre-trained model from Google that generates numerical representations (**embeddings**) of text data, capturing semantic similarity.
   * Used during training to refine information selection process

10. K-means Clustering:
    * **Unsupervised** machine learning technique for **grouping similar data** points into clusters.
    * PROCESS :
        * Randomly assigns data points to initial clusters (**centroids**).
        * Calculates the distance between each data point and the centroid of its assigned cluster.
        * Reassigns data points to the **closest** centroid, potentially changing the cluster centroids.
        * Repeats steps 2-4 until clusters stabilize.

12. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
    * **Supervised** machine learning algorithm for classification based on the **proximity of new data points to existing** labeled data points.
    * Process:
        * Calculates the distance between a new data point and all data points in the training set.
        * Identifies the **K closest neighbors** based on the chosen distance metric.
        * Assigns the new data point to the most frequent class label among its K neighbors.
